<h1 align="center">ðŸš€ðŸš€ CUDA Benchmark ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥</h1>

## Description
A small benchmarking test comparing CPU and GPU performance on CUDA.<br>
This project serves as a test environment for the Fractal-Art project, for which I want to use the CUDA API to speed up the rendering process.<br>

Check out the Fractal-Art project [here](https://github.com/AlexJMercer/Fractal-Art).<br>

## Installation
Instructions on how to install and set up the project.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AlexJMercer/CUDA-Bench.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd CUDA-Bench
```

## Usage
Just simply run the project.<br>
This project also specifically uses the MSVC compiler, as that is the only compiler that supports CUDA.<br>
Keep in mind, you need to have CUDA Toolkit installed on your machine, and of course, have a compatible NVIDIA GPU.<br>

```bash
# Run the project (Compilation with MSVC, scripts written in run.bat)
run.bat
```

## Contributing
